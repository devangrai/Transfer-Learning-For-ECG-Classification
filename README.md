## Installation

Make sure that your virtual environment satisfies the following requirements before running any code:

* Python version: `>=3.5.2`
* Dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Steps for Running Code

1. Download the Icentia11k dataset. Follow the instructions from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09570. Let's assume now that the downloaded data is in the data/icentia11k directory.
2. Download the PhysioNet Challenge 2017 dataset. Follow instructions at https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/. Once downloaded, extract the archive with all recordings into the data/physionet directory.
3. To run the code, navigate to Transfer_Learning_for_ECG_Classification.ipynb and run the cells.
